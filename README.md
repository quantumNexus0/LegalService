## üí° Future Plans

- **API Development**: A public API will be developed to allow third-party services to access lawyer data and integrate it into their own platforms for a fee.  
- **Monetization**: Once the platform is fully developed, the data can be sold to other businesses or platforms through API access.  
- **Payment System**: We plan to integrate a secure payment gateway for booking consultations and handling transactions between users and lawyers.  
- **Legal Resource Center**: Develop a section for educational content, templates, and articles that can help users understand common legal procedures and terms.
